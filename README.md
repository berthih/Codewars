# Codewars

This repository contains some of the exercise I've done on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com) this website helped me a lot when I had to learn a new langage or when I wanted to train my mind on algorithmic stuff.

I chose only few of the exercise I made on codewars if you want to see every algorithm I completed you can go on [berthih]( https://www.codewars.com/users/berthih)
